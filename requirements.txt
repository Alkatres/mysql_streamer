# This list is a specific list of packages to make your application work.
# This is what will be inside of the inenv and deployed to production.
# You should be updating this list from 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'

# Need this because mysql-replication on internal pypi is old.
# Since it is a hit, no fallback to python's pypi happens
