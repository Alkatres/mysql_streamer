README for the replication handler

To make a virtualenv consistent with what will be running the batch and have all testing tools:
make venv-dev

Manual testing (TODO remove when acceptance testing works):
fig build
fig up -d
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u yelpdev -D yelp -P 8001 < /scratch/ryani/business_small.sql
python replication_handler/batch/parse_replication_stream.py -v --no-notification

make sure it prints out the topic that would be published to kafka

Setting up the docs on dev:
cd docs/build/html
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
visit http://<your dev machine>:8888/index.html, you will have mini docs server up, maybe useful.

Why there is a directory devdbs/ instead of using standard dev database(s):
When we started the development of replication handler, dbas have not upgrade the dbs to MySQL5.6,
it seemed easier to just use Docker to setup some databases for development and testing.
